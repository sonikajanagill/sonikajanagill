<br />

I am a Lead Backend Engineer and Tech Advocate with 19 years of experience spanning Java/J2EE enterprise systems, WebSphere Commerce, and modern cloud-native AI/ML solutions. My journey has taken me from building insurance platforms to architecting scalable cloud solutions on GCP, AWS, and Azure.

As a passionate technologist, I specialize in MLOps, Generative AI, and cloud architecture, with deep expertise in Vertex AI, LangChain, RAG systems, and multi-cloud deployments. I'm a **Google Cloud Professional Architect** and **Professional ML Engineer**, with a growing interest in emerging technologies like Quantum Computing.

Beyond my technical work, I'm deeply committed to community building and knowledge sharing. Through my blogs, tech talks, and mentoring sessions, I aim to help developers navigate the exciting world of AI/ML and cloud technologies. I'm especially passionate about supporting women in tech and creating inclusive tech communities.

Whether you're building your first ML pipeline or architecting complex multi-cloud solutions, I'm here to share insights from my 19-year journey. Let's connect and build amazing things together! 💻☁️🚀
